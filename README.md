# PortScanner

A simple port scanning script

# Usage

To install the requirements go to your command prompt and type "pip install -r requirements.txt"
To use the script download the rar file and run the exe and enter the ip you would like to scan
The port scanner checks for port 53,80, and 443, if the ports are open there will be a green text next to the port saying open
If the port is not open then it will simply not show it.
